Welcome to my blog! I'm a high schooler passionate about engineering, data science, and community service. Here, I share my journey through coursework like digital electronics, engineering design, computer graphics, and Python coding. Beyond academics, I'm involved in volleyball, serve my community by supporting individuals with cerebral palsy, and participate in the National Honor Society.
